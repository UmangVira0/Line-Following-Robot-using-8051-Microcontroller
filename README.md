# Line-Following-Robot-using-8051-Microcontroller
The aim of this project is to create a line following robot with auto path finding abilities using 8051 using only assembly language. In this project i created a station system consisting of seven stops, the user only needs to input the destination and the robot identifies its location and finds the shortest path to the destination. The stops are in an 8 formation with a seventh stop in middle of one of the circles. 
Few conditions are setup like, the robot can only go clockwise.
